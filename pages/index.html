							<h1>Welcome to Event Manager</h1>
							<br>
							<p>Managing an event is a hard task, especially when the event involves hundreds of attendees. Manually managing the attendees for the event, invitations, and waiting lists is very tedious. It will be more profitable and efficient to have a web app to take care of all of the logistics of an event making sure everyone will attend.</p>
							<p>Our program makes it easier to sign up for and organize events. One of the ways it makes it easier is if an event is sold out, this program will automatically create a waiting list. In addition, this program will provide each guest with a unique QR code, which may be utilized to access an event more quickly. Another purpose of this tool is to provide real-time event statistics that organizers can use to plan future events. Therefore this program could help an organizer manage large events more efficiently. The main goal for this program is to facilitate the process of signing up for an event and to manage an event. Specifically, this program will provide an automatic waiting list in case an event is full. Additionally, this application will give each attendee a unique QR code, which would be used as a faster way to enter an event. Another goal for this program is to offer real-time statistics of an event so the organizers can review for future events. Lastly, an organizer could use this application to efficiently manage large events.</p>
